# 💖 Interactive Valentine Proposal

A playful, interactive web experience designed to ask that special someone to be your Valentine. This project features a "fleeing" No button, a live countdown, and a celebratory confetti finish.

## ✨ Features

* **Dynamic Personalization:** Pass a name through the URL to customize the proposal.
* **The Runaway "No" Button:** A cheeky script that prevents the user from clicking "No" by moving the button away on hover or touch.
* **Live Countdown:** Tracks the remaining time until February 14th in real-time.
* **Celebration:** Clicking "Yes" triggers a double-burst of confetti.
* **Fully Responsive:** Works beautifully on both desktop and mobile devices.
